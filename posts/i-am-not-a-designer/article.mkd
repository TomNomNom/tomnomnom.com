# I am not a designer

I've changed my design a little in the past couple of days - to a light, minimal one at first; and after a suggestion from [@scawp](http://twitter.com/scawp), to a dark one.

I knew it already, but it's really made me realise that I am *not* a designer. I had a really hard time just picking the colours.

Is this one a keeper? Hit the contact link at the top of the page and let me know. (And remind me that I need to finish my comments system).
