# Oooh! CSS an' that!

Hurrah! It's a little more than just text now. I've added a bit of CSS, and decided the [YUI CSS Reset](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/) thing is great. It all validates through the first [HTML5 validator](http://html5.validator.nu/?=&doc=http://www.tomnomnom.com/) I found with Google, and it doesn't look all that bad considering the paltry levels of effort I've put in so far.

At work we seem to be dealing with ever more fancy (or complicated, depending on your outlook) techniques for handling dynamic pages. I can't decide if I want to use some of the cool things I've seen or not. I could use [Smarty](http://www.smarty.net/), code my own template engine (rip one off), or perhaps I should just rebel: my web host provides SSH access - I could just hard-code the whole thing with vi :-D
