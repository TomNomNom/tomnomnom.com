# TLA Fail

It's official. I fail at CSS. [Adam](http://www.proxymoron.org/) told me so himself. Ok, he didn't say that exactly, but he didn't like my HTML5 doctype at all. On the bright side: he did give me a nice way to do the right-aligned date thing with CSS. It would seem that `float: right;` is (almost) all I needed. 

It also turns out that my web host want me to fill out a form, photocopy my drivers licence (or passport) and a utility bill, and then post it to them before I can have SSH access. Damn - SSH fail. 

I've been thinking a bit about how I'm going to handle the content of this page. Pagination could end up being an issue if I just continue to hard-code everything. The obvious choice is a simple database back-end, but I like the portability that static files give. Perhaps
[SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) is the answer? If you've got any suggestions: drop me an email on mail @ this domain.
