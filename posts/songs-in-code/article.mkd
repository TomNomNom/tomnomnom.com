# Songs in code

Yesterday morning (20th August), a few of my fellow developers and I started a little in-joke on twitter: [#songsincode](http://twitter.com/#search?q=songsincode). It is currently hovering around the #3 trend on the Twitter homepage. 

It's been great fun to see it rise up to this point, and thought the people involved in setting the ball rolling deserved credit: [@proxymoron](http://twitter.com/proxymoron), [@scawp](http://twitter.com/scawp), [@asmitter](http://twitter.com/asmitter), [@_SteveWilson_](http://twitter.com/_SteveWilson_), [@lingmops](http://twitter.com/lingmops) and myself [@tomnomnom](http://twitter.com/tomnomnom). Between us, we make up the development team at [FrogTrade Ltd](http://frogtrade.com) in Halifax, UK.

It all started with three tweets. 

Firstly from [@asmitter at 0958 GMT](http://twitter.com/asmitter/status/3424294807):

    $hiphip = array();


And then one from [@scawp at 1010 GMT](http://twitter.com/scawp/status/3424409949):

    name the singer :-p $val = array(); if(!comeOnOver($val)) { echo 'why?'; }


Finally, one from [@proxymoron at 1033 GMT](http://twitter.com/proxymoron/status/3424623779), with the addition of the hashtag:

    class me { function say($what) { if($what) == 'goodbye'; { die('A little'); } } #songsincode


After that, [@lingmops](http://twitter.com/lingmops), [@_SteveWilson_](http://twitter.com/_SteveWilson_) and myself got involved, and it started to snowball.

I think it was one of the more productive days we've had as a team. 

Yes. We are a little mad; but if you're interested in working with us, we are [hiring](http://frogtrade.com/index.phtml?d=323082).

**Update**: @asmitter has provided a far more in-depth (and more amusing) analysis here: [http://docs.google.com/View?id=dcg768xk_4ff83ftcd](http://docs.google.com/View?id=dcg768xk_4ff83ftcd)
