# That's my name!

I'm actually slightly envious of several friends of mine who have unusual names; not because I'd like to sound interesting simply by name - it's something far more pathetic than that. I want to be the first result in a Google search for my name.

Unfortunately, I share my name with an actor who was not only born in the same year as me, but who's *other 'alf* has the same (first) name as mine. Damn. And not only have I got "Baz from Grange Hill" to beat, but the owner of tomhudson.co.uk, a [magic man](http://www.tomhudsonmagic.co.uk) and countless others. 

At least I *should* have an easier job than my good friend [Mr Smith](http://andysmith.co.uk) would.
